# Handle Devices

## Version 1
This is a samll project of a flutter application for 
- check camera
- check printer
- check bluetooth
- check usb connected devices

### In this version of code all what i do that creating only ui(screens and widgets)
## the architecture is similar to mvvm but very basic.
- first i create one screen called main screen
- i create grid of 4 cards, each refer to service or check(like printer check, etc...)
- i try to make the user interface helpful and colorful


## Version 2
### In this version i try to make all services functional with user interface.
I used
- bloc battern to manage my states
- we caould say i used small piece of clean artechture like i used only one feature.
- i used a one package for each service(4 packages)
